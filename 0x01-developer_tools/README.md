# 0x01. Developer tools

## About this project
This project explores the developer tools, abbreviated as "devtools" from now on, provided by Google in their [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) web browser (and _some_ Chromium based web browsers, such as [Brave](https://brave.com/)).

This project was done in a web site made by Holberton School with the sole purpose of learning how to use the web browsers devtools, and to follow their recommendation, I used the Chrome/Chromium devtools. Trying to mimic the results with another browser and/or in another web site may yield different results.
