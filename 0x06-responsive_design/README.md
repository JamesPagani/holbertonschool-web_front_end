# 0x06. Responsive Design

## About
_This project tackles the concept of responsive design._

Turns out that the design of the web site we've done on the last 6 projects doesn't translate well when displayed on a smartphone. To fix this, we need to add a mobile version of the menu and to add CSS rules to modify the look of the web site should it be displayed on a smaller screen.
