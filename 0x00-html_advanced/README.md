# 0x00. Advanced HTML

This project focuses on building a website using only HTML. Each task is a progression on the previous task, with the focus being using different HTML tags.

## Credits for the images

For 36-index.html, the images for the _Works_, _About Us_, and _Latest news_ were randomly generated using [deepai](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img), a web app that randomly generates images based on a description with odd results at most (which can explain why some of the images there might not make sense).

For the _Testimonials_ section in the same document, 36-index.html, I got the people pictures from [UI Faces](https://uifaces.co/), which allows you to get faces for avatar purposes, but **BE AWARE SINCE THEY HAVE A COPYRIGHT** (the ones I'm using allows me to use them for mockup purposes, which happens to be the purpose of this project).
